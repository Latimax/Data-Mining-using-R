# Loan Approval

**Author:** Shaibu Abdullateef Topa 

**Student ID:** CST/20/COM/00591  

**Course Title:** Data Mining

**Course Code:** CSC4316

**Date:** 2025-03-12

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
```

## About the Dataset

The Loan Approval Prediction Dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains information
about loan applicants and their loan approval status. Key features include:

- **Demographic information**: Number of dependents, education level, self-employment status
- **Financial information**: Annual income, loan amount requested, loan term
- **Credit information**: CIBIL score
- **Asset information**: Residential, commercial, and luxury asset values, bank asset value
- **Target variable**: Loan status (Approved/Rejected)

The dataset consists of **4,269** entries with **13** features, providing a
comprehensive view of factors potentially influencing loan approval decisions.
In this dataset we will be doing binary classification since we are predicting
if the loan application of an applicant will be approved or rejected based on
the given features.

## 1. Data Collection

```{r load, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(knitr)

# Load the Data Set
loan_data <- read.csv("loan_approval.csv")

```

```{r show few rows, echo=FALSE}

# Split columns into two halves
half_cols <- ceiling(ncol(loan_data) / 2)

# First table (left side)
kable(head(loan_data[, 1:half_cols]), 
      caption = "First Few Rows of Loan Data (Part 1)")

# Second table (right side)
kable(head(loan_data[, (half_cols + 1):ncol(loan_data)]), 
      caption = "First Few Rows of Loan Data (Part 2)")


```
---

## 2. Feature Engineering  

**Drop irrelavant columns**

```{r}

# Remove specified columns and show shape
loan_data <- loan_data[, !(names(loan_data) %in% c("loan_id"))]

# No. of rows & Columns in the loan_data (shape)
dim(loan_data)

```
---

**Loan data structure**
```{r}
# Display the structure of the loan_data data frame
str(loan_data)

```
As we can see in the output.
- The dataset consists of  `4269 ` records
- There are a total of  `12` features
- There are three types of datatype `dtypes:  int(9), char(3)`
- Also, We can check how many missing values available in the `Non-Null Count` 
column

---

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Load the psych package
library(psych)

# Display descriptive statistics of the loan_data data frame
describe(loan_data)

```
---

**Finding the unique values**
```{r}
# Define a function to print unique values of a column
uniquevals <- function(col_name, df) {
  cat(sprintf("Unique Values in %s are: %s\n", col_name, 
              paste(unique(df[[col_name]]), collapse = ", ")))
}

# Iterate over each column in the data frame and print unique values
for (col_name in colnames(loan_data)) {
  uniquevals(col_name, loan_data)
  cat(rep("-", 75), "\n")
}

```
---

**Checking categorical and numerical features**
```{r}
# Identify categorical and numerical columns without dplyr
cat_var <- names(loan_data)[sapply(loan_data, function(x) is.factor(x) || is.character(x))]
num_var <- names(loan_data)[sapply(loan_data, is.numeric)]

# Print the column names with labels
cat("Categorical Variables:\n")
print(cat_var)

```
```{r}

cat("\nNumerical Variables:\n")
print(num_var)

```

---

## 3. Data Cleaning

**Checking for duplicate rows**
```{r}
# Check for duplicates based on all columns
duplicates_all <- loan_data[duplicated(loan_data), ]

# Print the results
print(duplicates_all)

```
It is clear that there are no duplicates

---

**Handling null values**
```{r}
# Count missing values in each column
colSums(is.na(loan_data))

```
---

**Counting zeros of each column**
```{r}
# Count zeros in each column
zero_counts <- colSums(loan_data == 0)

# Print the zero counts
print(zero_counts)

```
Assuming that `residential_assets_value`, `commercial_assets_value`, and
`bank_asset_value` cannot be zero, we treat zero values as null values and
replace them with the respective column mean. However, it's noteworthy that this
process does not take into account the variable `no_of_dependents`.

---

**Replace with mean**
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Calculate means for the columns, ignoring zeros
mean_residential_assets <- mean(loan_data$residential_assets_value
                                [loan_data$residential_assets_value != 0],
                                na.rm = TRUE)
mean_commercial_assets <- mean(loan_data$commercial_assets_value
                               [loan_data$commercial_assets_value != 0],
                               na.rm = TRUE)
mean_bank_assets <- mean(loan_data$bank_asset_value
                         [loan_data$bank_asset_value != 0], 
                         na.rm = TRUE)

# Replace zeros with means in the specified columns
loan_data$residential_assets_value[loan_data$residential_assets_value == 0] <- mean_residential_assets
loan_data$commercial_assets_value[loan_data$commercial_assets_value == 0] <- mean_commercial_assets
loan_data$bank_asset_value[loan_data$bank_asset_value == 0] <- mean_bank_assets

# Count zeros in each column
zero_counts <- colSums(loan_data == 0)

# Print the zero counts
print(zero_counts)


```
The `loan_data` now reflects the replacement of zeros in the specified columns
with their respective means

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis

**Charts for features**

```{r chart, fig.height=10, fig.width=10, echo=FALSE}
# Set up plot layout and margins
par(mfrow = c(3, 3), mar = c(4, 4, 2, 1), oma = c(0, 0, 2, 0))

# Columns to exclude from e7 formatting
exclude_cols <- c("no_of_dependents", "loan_term", "cibil_score")

# Select numeric columns
numeric_cols <- sapply(loan_data, is.numeric)

# Plot histograms with formatted axes
for (col in names(loan_data)[numeric_cols]) {
  # Check if column needs e7 formatting
  use_e7 <- !(col %in% exclude_cols)
  
  # Create histogram without axes
  hist(loan_data[[col]], 
       main = col, 
       xlab = if (use_e7) paste0(col, " (e7)") else col,
       col = "steelblue", 
       border = "white", 
       axes = FALSE)
  
  # Add custom x-axis with or without e7 formatting
  if (use_e7) {
    axis(1, at = pretty(loan_data[[col]]), labels = pretty(loan_data[[col]]) / 1e7)
  } else {
    axis(1)
  }
  
  # Add y-axis
  axis(2)
}


```


---

**Loan Status Distribution**

```{r loan_status_distribution}
# Load ggplot2
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(loan_data, aes(x=factor(loan_status), fill=factor(loan_status))) +
  geom_bar(alpha=0.7) +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Loan Approval Distribution") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("steelblue", "chocolate"), labels = c("Rejected", "Approved")) +
  labs(x = "Loan Status", fill = "Status")

```
The dataset shows that there are more 'Approved' instances than 'Rejected', 
indicating an imbalance.

```{r}

# Plot count of no_of_dependents
ggplot(loan_data, aes(x = factor(no_of_dependents), fill = factor(no_of_dependents))) +
  geom_bar() +
  ggtitle("Number of Dependents") +
  xlab("Number of Dependents") +
  ylab("Count") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#4682B4", "#D8843F", "#32CD32", "#FFD700", "#FF6347", "#00DDE6")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```
The chart shows the count of dependents for loan applicants, highlighting a
clear difference in living arrangements. Notably, there isn't a substantial
variance in the count of dependents. However, it's worth noting that as the
number of dependents increases, the disposable income of the applicant tends to
decrease. Consequently, I hypothesize that applicants with 0 or 1 dependent
might have higher chances of loan approval.

---

**Number of Dependants Vs Loan Status**
```{r}
# Plot count of no_of_dependents with loan_status as hue
ggplot(loan_data, aes(x = factor(no_of_dependents), fill = loan_status)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  ggtitle("Number of Dependents by Loan Status") +
  xlab("Number of Dependents") +
  ylab("Count") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("steelblue", "orange"), labels = c("Approved", "Rejected")) +
  theme_minimal()

```
The bar graph implies that having more dependents is associated with a higher
chance of loan rejection. However, it's noteworthy that the number of approved
loans doesn't significantly change, even for individuals with more family
members. This challenges the idea that loans are less likely to be approved for
those with more dependents. The key takeaway is the importance of relying on
observed data rather than assumptions, as the real outcomes may differ from what
was initially expected.

---

**Education and Self Employed**

```{r}

# Plot self_employed with education
ggplot(loan_data, aes(x = factor(self_employed), fill = education)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  ggtitle("Self Employed") +
  xlab("Self Employed") +
  ylab("Count") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("steelblue", "orange")) +
  theme_minimal()


```

The graph depicting the relationship between the employment status of applicants
and their education levels highlights important trends for loan approval
considerations. It reveals that a majority of non-graduate applicants are
self-employed, while most graduate applicants are not self-employed. This
indicates that graduates are more likely to be employed in salaried positions,
whereas non-graduates tend to be self-employed.

---

**Education and Income**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Load patchwork for combining plots
library(patchwork)

# Custom formatter to display values in e7 format
e7_formatter <- function(x) {
  sprintf("%.1f", x / 1e7)
}

# Boxplot with custom colors and e7 formatting
boxplot <- ggplot(loan_data, aes(x = factor(education), y = income_annum, fill = education)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("steelblue", "orange")) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = e7_formatter) +
  ggtitle("Boxplot: Education vs Income") +
  xlab("Education") +
  ylab("Income Annum (e7)") +
  theme_minimal()

# Violin plot with custom colors and e7 formatting
violinplot <- ggplot(loan_data, aes(x = factor(education), y = income_annum, fill = education)) +
  geom_violin() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("steelblue", "orange")) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = e7_formatter) +
  ggtitle("Violin Plot: Education vs Income") +
  xlab("Education") +
  ylab("Income Annum (e7)") +
  theme_minimal()

# Combine plots side by side
boxplot + violinplot


```

The combination of *boxplot* and *violinplot* visualizations provides insights
into the relationship between education levels of loan applicants and their
annual incomes. The boxplot reveals that both graduates and non-graduates have
similar median incomes, indicating that having a degree doesn't necessarily lead
to a significant income advantage.
Moreover the violinplot shows the distribution of income among the graduates and
non graduate applicants, where we can see that non graduate applicants have a
even distribution between income `2000000 and 8000000` , whereas there is a
uneven distribution among the graduates with more applicants having income
between `6000000` and `8000000` Since there is not much change in annual income
of graduates and non graduates, I assume that education does not play a major
role in the approval of loan.

---

**Education Vs Loan Status**
```{r}
# Create the plot with custom colors
ggplot(loan_data, aes(x = education, fill = loan_status)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("steelblue", "orange")) +
  ggtitle("Loan Status by Education") +
  xlab("Education") +
  ylab("Count") +
  theme_minimal()


```
The graph indicates that there's only a small difference between the number of
loans approved and rejected for both graduate and non-graduate applicants. This
difference is so small that it doesn't seem to be significant.

---

**Loan Amount vs Loan Status**
```{r}

# Create the plot
ggplot(loan_data, aes(x = loan_status, y = loan_amount, fill = loan_status)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.color = "red", outlier.shape = 16, outlier.size = 2) +
  ggtitle("Loan Amount vs Loan Status") +
  xlab("Loan Status") +
  ylab("Loan Amount") +
   scale_fill_manual(values = c("steelblue", "orange")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 14))


```



---

**CIBIL Score Distribution**
CIBIL Score ranges and their meaning.
```{r}
# Create data frame
cibil_scores <- data.frame(
  CIBIL = c("300-549", "550-649", "650-749", "750-799", "800-900"),
  Meaning = c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very Good", "Excellent")
)

# Print the table
print(cibil_scores)


```
---

```{r}
# Load ggplot2 library
library(ggplot2)

# Plot histogram with red trend line
ggplot(loan_data, aes(x = cibil_score)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "green", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_density(color = "red", size = 1) +  # Red line to show changes
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(300, 900, 100), limits = c(300, 900)) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of CIBIL Score") +
  xlab("CIBIL Score") +
  ylab("Count") +
  theme_minimal()


```

Analyzing the table reveals that a majority of customers have low CIBIL scores,
specifically below 649. This might pose challenges for them in getting loan
approvals. However, there's a notable portion of customers with high scores,
exceeding 649, which is advantageous for the bank. It opens the opportunity for
the bank to provide special treatment, such as attractive deals and offers, to
attract these high-score customers to take loans from the bank. From this, we
can infer that individuals with higher CIBIL scores are likely to have a higher
chance of getting their loans approved. Typically, higher scores indicate better
financial management.

---

**CIBIL Score Vs Loan Status**
```{r}

# Load ggplot2 library
library(ggplot2)

# Violin plot: CIBIL Score vs Loan Status
ggplot(loan_data, aes(x = loan_status, y = cibil_score, fill = loan_status)) +
  geom_violin(trim = FALSE, color = "black") +  # Violin plot with border
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.1, color = "red", outlier.color = "red", outlier.shape = 16) +  # Outlier line
   scale_fill_manual(values = c("steelblue", "orange")) +
  labs(title = "CIBIL Score vs Loan Status", x = "Loan Status", y = "CIBIL Score") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")  # Remove legend


```
The violin plot distinctly illustrates that individuals with approved loans
generally possess higher CIBIL scores, predominantly exceeding 600. In contrast,
for those with rejected loans, scores exhibit greater variability and tend to be
lower, often below 550. This underscores the significance of having a higher
CIBIL score, particularly surpassing 600, in significantly boosting the chances
of loan approval. The graph unmistakably highlights the pivotal role of a good
CIBIL score in the loan approval process.

---

**Asset Distribution**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Load libraries
library(gridExtra)
library(scales)

# Function to format labels in e7
format_e7 <- function(x) sprintf("%.1f", x / 1e7)

# Create individual histograms with e7 formatting
p1 <- ggplot(loan_data, aes(x = luxury_assets_value)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "red", color = "black", bins = 30) +
  ggtitle("Luxury Assets") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = format_e7) +
  theme_minimal()

p2 <- ggplot(loan_data, aes(x = bank_asset_value)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "blue", color = "black", bins = 30) +
  ggtitle("Bank Assets") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = format_e7) +
  theme_minimal()

p3 <- ggplot(loan_data, aes(x = residential_assets_value)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "green", color = "black", bins = 30) +
  ggtitle("Residential Assets") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = format_e7) +
  theme_minimal()

p4 <- ggplot(loan_data, aes(x = commercial_assets_value)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "black", color = "white", bins = 30) +
  ggtitle("Commercial Assets") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = format_e7) +
  theme_minimal()

# Arrange the plots in a 2x2 grid
grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, ncol = 2)


```
These graphs (x-axis to e7) reveal a trend where the majority of individuals
possess lower-valued assets, and the count of people with more valuable assets
gradually decreases. This insight enhances our understanding of how assets play
a role in influencing loan decisions.

---

**Assets vs Loan Status**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(scales)
# Gather asset values into long format for easier plotting
loan_data_long <- loan_data %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(
    cols = c(luxury_assets_value, bank_asset_value, residential_assets_value, commercial_assets_value),
    names_to = "Asset_Type",
    values_to = "Asset_Value"
  )

# Plot with e7 formatting
ggplot(loan_data_long, aes(x = Asset_Value, fill = loan_status)) +
  geom_histogram(position = "stack", bins = 30, color = "black") +
  facet_wrap(~Asset_Type, scales = "free_x") +
  labs(title = "Asset Values by Loan Status", x = "Asset Value (x10^7)", y = "Count") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = function(x) sprintf("%.1f", x / 1e7)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("steelblue", "orange")) +
  theme_minimal()



```
The provided graphs offer valuable insights into the role of assets as a safety
net for the bank in loan approvals. Both visual representations suggest that as
the value of assets increases, there is a slight upward trend in the likelihood
of loan approval, accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the chances of
rejection. This observation underscores the importance of assets in influencing
and mitigating risks in the loan approval process.

---


**Loan Amount vs Income**
```{r}

# Load libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)

# Create scatter plot with e7 formatting
ggplot(loan_data, aes(x = income_annum, y = loan_amount)) +
  geom_point(color = "steelblue") +
  labs(title = "Income vs Loan Amount", x = "Annual Income (e7)", y = "Loan Amount (e7)") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = function(x) sprintf("%.1f", x / 1e7)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(y) sprintf("%.1f", y / 1e7)) +
  theme_minimal()


```

The relationship between loan amount and the applicant's annual income is
straightforward. When the income is higher, the loan amount tends to be higher
as well. This correlation is rooted in the fact that the applicant's income
significantly influences the determination of a suitable loan amount they can
comfortably repay.

---

**Assets vs Loan Amount**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Load libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
library(scales)

# List of assets
assets <- c("luxury_assets_value", "bank_asset_value", "residential_assets_value", "commercial_assets_value")
titles <- c("Luxury Assets vs Loan Amount", "Bank Assets vs Loan Amount", "Residential Assets vs Loan Amount", "Commercial Assets vs Loan Amount")

# Create plots
plots <- lapply(1:4, function(i) {
  ggplot(loan_data, aes_string(x = assets[i], y = "loan_amount")) +
    geom_point(color = "steelblue") +
    scale_x_continuous(labels = function(x) sprintf("%.1f", x / 1e7)) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = function(y) sprintf("%.1f", y / 1e7)) +
    labs(title = titles[i], x = "Asset Value (e7)", y = "Loan Amount (e7)") +
    theme_minimal()
})

# Arrange plots in one row
grid.arrange(grobs = plots, ncol = 2)


```
The observation indicates that possessing more assets enhances the probability
of securing a larger loan from the bank. However, it's worth noting the presence
of outliers, signifying instances where individuals with comparatively fewer
assets may still obtain larger loans.

---


**Label Encoding the categorical variables**
```{r}
# Label Encoding
loan_data$education <- ifelse(loan_data$education == " Not Graduate", 0, 1)
loan_data$self_employed <- ifelse(loan_data$self_employed == " No", 0, 1)
loan_data$loan_status <- ifelse(loan_data$loan_status == " Rejected", 0, 1)

# View the result
head(loan_data)


```
Now all features are numerical.

---

**Histograms for each feature**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Load necessary libraries

library(scales)  # For e7 formatting


# List of columns to exclude from formatting
excluded_cols <- c("loan_status", "cibil_score", "loan_term", "self_employed", "no_of_dependents", "education")

# Convert data to long format, excluding specific columns
loan_data_long <- loan_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -all_of(excluded_cols), names_to = "Variable", values_to = "Value")

# Plot histograms with density and e7 formatting (only for selected columns)
ggplot(loan_data_long, aes(x = Value)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density)), fill = "red", color = "black", bins = 30) +
  geom_density(color = "black") +

  scale_x_continuous(labels = function(x) sprintf("%.1f", x / 1e7)) +  # Format X-axis to e7
  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(y) sprintf("%.0f", y * 1e10)) +  # Format Y-axis 
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Selected Variables", x = "Value", y = "Density")


```

# Format the relevant columns to e7
loan_data_formatted <- loan_data %>%

    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold")
  )

```

**Correlation Matrix**

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=16, fig.height=16}
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)

# Correlation Between Features


# First, clean the spaces in character columns
loan_data_clean <- loan_data
char_cols <- sapply(loan_data, is.character)

for (col in names(loan_data)[char_cols]) {
  loan_data_clean[[col]] <- trimws(loan_data_clean[[col]])
}

# Make a copy for correlation
loan_data_corr <- loan_data_clean

# Encode binary categorical variables
binary_cats <- c('education', 'self_employed', 'loan_status')
encoding_map <- list(
  education = c('Not Graduate' = 0, 'Graduate' = 1),
  self_employed = c('No' = 0, 'Yes' = 1),
  loan_status = c('Rejected' = 0, 'Approved' = 1)
)



# Create and plot correlation matrix
library(corrplot)
# Only include numeric columns
numeric_cols <- sapply(loan_data_corr, is.numeric)
corr_matrix <- cor(loan_data_corr[, numeric_cols], use = "complete.obs")

# Plot
corrplot(corr_matrix, method = "color", type = "upper", 
         addCoef.col = "black", number.cex = 0.7,
         tl.col = "black", tl.srt = 45,
         col = colorRampPalette(c("blue", "lightblue", "red"))(200),
         title = "Correlation Heatmap")

```

The heatmap of correlation values shows several strong connections:

1. **Luxury asset and Bank Assets**
2. **Income and Luxury Assets**
3. **Income and Bank Assets**
4. **Luxury Assets and Loan Amount**
5. **Bank Assets and Loan Amount**
6. **Loan Status and Cibil Score**
7. **Loan Amount and Income**

The correlation between assets is logical, given their shared classification as
types of assets. Similarly, the association between income and both luxury and
bank assets aligns with the expectation that individuals with higher incomes
typically accumulate more assets.
Now, let's see how assets relate to the loan amount and how income is connected
to the loan amount. This will help us understand what factors influence the size
of approved loans. And, just as a reminder, we've already talked about how your
CIBIL score relates to whether your loan gets approved or not..

**View correlations**

```{r}
# Calculate correlation with 'loan_status'

## 5. Data Preprocessing

**Outlier Detection**

-Using Zscore method

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)

# Calculate Z-scores for each numeric column
numeric_cols <- loan_data %>% select(where(is.numeric))

# Calculate Z-scores
z_scores <- as.data.frame(scale(numeric_cols))

# Set a threshold for Z-score (e.g., 3)
threshold <- 3

# Identify outliers (rows with at least one Z-score > threshold)
outliers <- loan_data[rowSums(abs(z_scores) > threshold) > 0, ]

# Count the number of outliers
cat("Number of outliers:", nrow(outliers), "\n")


```


I have tested Outlier detection but haven't implemented because it decreases
the accuracy and the accuracy is significantly higher without it

---

```{r}
# Drop 'loan_status' column from the dataset
X <- loan_data %>% select(-loan_status)

# Get the target variable 'loan_status'
loan_status_result <- loan_data$loan_status

# Check value counts
table(loan_status_result)


```
It is clearly unbalanced data, so we need to oversample the minority class

---

```{r}
library(themis)
library(recipes)

# Apply SMOTE using recipes (tidymodels framework)
loan_data$education <- as.integer(factor(loan_data$education))
loan_data$loan_status <- factor(loan_data$loan_status)
loan_data$self_employed <- as.integer(factor(loan_data$self_employed))

# Now apply SMOTE
rec <- recipe(loan_status ~ ., data = loan_data) %>%
  step_smote(loan_status, over_ratio = 1) %>%
  prep() %>%
  bake(new_data = NULL)

table(rec$loan_status)

loan_data <- rec
```

---

**Verify balanced class**

```{r}
# Load ggplot2
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(loan_data, aes(x=factor(loan_status), fill=factor(loan_status))) +
  geom_bar(alpha=0.7) +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Loan Approval Distribution") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("steelblue", "chocolate"), labels = c("Rejected", "Approved")) +
  labs(x = "Loan Status", fill = "Status")

```

---

## 6. ML Modelling with KNN

**Conversion & Normalization**

```{r}
#Convert Categorical Variables - Since KNN works best with numerical data, convert categorical variables into factors.

loan_data$education <- as.factor(loan_data$education)

loan_data$self_employed <- as.factor(loan_data$self_employed)

#Normalize Numerical Features

#Formula
normalize <- function(x) {
  return((x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x)))
}

# Normalize relevant numerical columns
loan_data[, c("no_of_dependents", "income_annum", "loan_amount", "loan_term", 
              "cibil_score", "residential_assets_value", "commercial_assets_value", "luxury_assets_value", "bank_asset_value")] <- 
  apply(loan_data[, c("no_of_dependents", "income_annum", "loan_amount", "loan_term", 
                      "cibil_score", "residential_assets_value", "commercial_assets_value", "luxury_assets_value", "bank_asset_value")], 
        2, normalize)

#Show first rows
head(loan_data)

```

**Training the KNN Model**
`-Split Data into Training & Testing Sets
`-Using Hold Out Estimation

```{r}
# Load required library
library(caTools)

set.seed(64)

# Split the data (80% train, 20% test)
split <- sample.split(loan_data$loan_status, SplitRatio = 0.8)
train_data <- subset(loan_data, split == TRUE)
test_data <- subset(loan_data, split == FALSE)

# Check split result
table(train_data$loan_status)
table(test_data$loan_status)

``` 

---

**Prepare Data for KNN**

```{r}

#Remove categorical variables and separate labels (target variable):

# Load KNN library
library(class)

# Remove categorical columns for KNN (excluding target variable)
train_features <- train_data[, sapply(train_data, is.numeric)]
test_features <- test_data[, sapply(test_data, is.numeric)]

# Extract target labels
train_labels <- train_data$loan_status
test_labels <- test_data$loan_status

table(train_labels)
table(test_labels)

```

---

**Check best K value**

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(class)    # For KNN
library(caret)    # For confusion matrix

# Define a sequence of k values to test
k_values <- 1:20

# Initialize vector to store accuracy values
accuracy_scores <- numeric(length(k_values))

# Loop through k values
for (i in k_values) {
  # Train KNN model
  knn_pred <- knn(train = train_features, test = test_features, cl = train_labels, k = i)
  
  # Compute accuracy
  conf_matrix <- confusionMatrix(factor(knn_pred, levels = unique(train_labels)), 
                                 factor(test_labels, levels = unique(train_labels)))
  accuracy_scores[i] <- conf_matrix$overall["Accuracy"]
}

# Find the best k value
best_k <- k_values[which.max(accuracy_scores)]
cat("Best k:", best_k, "with Accuracy:", max(accuracy_scores), "\n")

# Plot Accuracy vs. k
plot(k_values, accuracy_scores, type = "o", col = "blue", pch = 16, xlab = "K Value", ylab = "Accuracy",
     main = "KNN Accuracy vs. K Value")
grid()


```
The best k value is randomly between 8 and 15, for simplicity 12 will be chosen.

---



**Train KNN Model**

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(class)  # For KNN
library(caret)  # For confusionMatrix
library(e1071)  # Required for confusionMatrix

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(42)

# Define a function to compute Euclidean distance
euclidean_distance <- function(x1, x2) {
  sqrt(sum((x1 - x2)^2))
}

# Standardize the features to ensure fair distance computation
train_features_scaled <- scale(train_features)
test_features_scaled <- scale(test_features)

# Define K value
k_value <- 12

# Train KNN model with Euclidean distance
#Since knn() in the class package already defaults to Euclidean distance, this ensures that all feature values are standardized before applying KNN, which is important when using distance-based algorithms.

knn_pred <- knn(train = train_features_scaled, 
                test = test_features_scaled, 
                cl = train_labels, 
                k = k_value)

# Convert test labels and predictions to factors with the same levels
test_labels <- factor(test_labels, levels = unique(train_labels))
knn_pred <- factor(knn_pred, levels = unique(train_labels))

```

## 8. Model Evalution (Confusion Matrix and Classification Report)

**Confusion Matrix**

```{r}
library(caret)
library(ggplot2)

# Create confusion matrix
conf_matrix <- confusionMatrix(knn_pred, test_labels)

# Extract confusion matrix as table
cm_table <- as.data.frame(conf_matrix$table)

# Plot confusion matrix
ggplot(cm_table, aes(x = Reference, y = Prediction, fill = Freq)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white") +
  geom_text(aes(label = Freq), color = "black", size = 5) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "lightblue", high = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Confusion Matrix", x = "Actual", y = "Predicted") +
  theme_minimal()

print(conf_matrix)


```


---

**Accuracy & Statistics**

```{r}
# Install knitr if not already installed
if (!require(knitr)) install.packages("knitr", dependencies = TRUE)

# Extract performance metrics
accuracy <- round(conf_matrix$overall["Accuracy"], 4)
precision <- round(conf_matrix$byClass["Precision"], 4)
recall <- round(conf_matrix$byClass["Recall"], 4)
f1_score <- round(conf_matrix$byClass["F1"], 4)

# Create a data frame to hold the metrics
metrics_df <- data.frame(
  Metric = c("Accuracy", "Precision", "Recall", "F1 Score"),
  Value = c(accuracy, precision, recall, f1_score)
)

# Display the table nicely
knitr::kable(metrics_df, caption = "Model Performance Metrics")

```


---


```{r}
# Load required libraries
library(pROC)
library(ggplot2)

# ROC Curve and AUC
knn_prob <- as.numeric(knn_pred) - 1  # Convert factor predictions to numeric if needed
roc_curve <- roc(test_labels, knn_prob)

# Calculate AUC
auc_value <- auc(roc_curve)

# Plot the ROC curve
ggplot(data = data.frame(FPR = roc_curve$specificities, TPR = roc_curve$sensitivities), aes(x = 1 - FPR, y = TPR)) +
  geom_line(color = "darkorange", size = 1.2) +
  geom_abline(linetype = "dashed", color = "navy") +
  labs(
    title = "Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve",
    x = "False Positive Rate",
    y = "True Positive Rate"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  annotate("text", x = 0.6, y = 0.1, label = paste("AUC =", round(auc_value, 2)), color = "black", size = 5)

```

The ROC Curve with an AUC of 0.92 further confirms the model's strong ability to distinguish between classes.
